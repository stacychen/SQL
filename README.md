## SQL

I'm learning SQL and this is where I keep my scripts. I'm using data from Kaggle to write SQL queries. The scripts are kept in the following folders:

* One table: scripts that only use only one table.
* Two tables or more: scripts that use two or more tables.
* SQL requests in R: writing R requests in SQL. 

Copy the scripts and run them [here](https://www.kaggle.com/lochleven/d/kaggle/meta-kaggle/competition-list1/edit)
